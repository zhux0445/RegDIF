# Using Lasso and Adaptive Lasso to Identify DIF in Multidimensional 2PL Models

The r file Reg_DIF_Main_Functions includes the main functions for three methods (LASSO EM, LASSO EMM, Adaptive LASSO).

The r file EMsteps includes functions for the E-step and M-steps used in main functions.

The file LRTcodes includes code for running likelihood ratio tests.

UniformLowCorAll and NonUnifAllSims are simulation studies. PowerCal calculates the simulation results.

Algorithm details can be found in the RunningDocumentation,
